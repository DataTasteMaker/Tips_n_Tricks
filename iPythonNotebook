Hi all

Please find below the common keyboard short-cuts

There are many available, however these are the ones frequently used/required when working on iPython Notebook.

    Y : to code
    M : to markdown
    R : to raw
    1 : heading 1, this can go up to 6, which changes the heading style
    Up Arrow or K: select cell above
    Down Arrow or J: select cell below
    Shift - Enter : run the selected cell, and then select below cell
    Ctrl - Enter : run the selected cell
    Alt - Enter : run the selected cell, insert a cell below
    A : Add/Insert a cell above the current one
    B : Add/Insert a cell below the current one
    D,D : Delete the cell (press D key twice)

And if the kernel gets stuck or it suspends...

    I,I : interrupt kernel
    0,0 : restart kernel ( this is number zero :)) 

Happy Learning!! Keep sharing!! :)

Thanks
Viraj
